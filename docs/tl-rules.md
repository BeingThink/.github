# Trust Level Rules

We will tag members according to these key words listed following.

## Trust Level 0 -- New

By default, all new users start out at trust level 0, meaning trust has yet to be earned. These are visitors who just created github account, and are still learning the community norms and the way your community works. New users’ abilities are restricted for safety – both theirs and yours.

## Trust Level 1 -- Basic

From Discourse, we also believe reading is the most fundamental and healthy action in any community. If a new user is willing to spend a little time reading, they will quickly be promoted to the first trust level.

Get to trust level 1 by:

+ Create an **issue** in any project.
+ Create an **Pull Request** in any project.
+ Submit some questions [here](https://github.com/orgs/BeingThink/discussions)
+ Contact us to understand some tech road by sending an email here——[contact@beingthink.com](contact@beingthink.com)

## Trust Level 2 -- Member
Members keep coming back to your community over a series of weeks; they have not only read, but actively participated long and consistently enough to be trusted with full citizenship.

Get to trust level 2 by:
+ 10 issues.
+ 5 PRs.
+ Join paid study.

## Trust Level 3 -- Regular
Regulars are the backbone of your community, the most active readers and reliable contributors over a period of months, even years. Because they're always around, they can be further trusted to help tidy up and organize the community.

To get to trust level 3, in the last 100 days, you can do like an member.

## Trust Level 4 -- Leader
Leaders are regulars who have been around forever and seen everything. They set a positive example for the community through their actions and their posts. If you need advice, these are the folks you turn to first, and they've earned the highest level of community trust, such that they are almost moderators within the community already.
